This project is an expense tracker build with React + Firebase 8. 

It uses the Firebase back-end to handle auth and the data base portion of the project.

Customs hooks are used to handle the authentification process and data requests to and from Firebase. 

Hooks like useState, useEffect and useRef together with useReducer are used. 

Styling is simple, custom CSS but in the future it will be updated with Tailwind or Bootstrap.
